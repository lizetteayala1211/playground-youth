			<p> <span id="bold-copy"> Greenhouse: </span> The Playground Greenhouse Initiative was created in pursuit of tackling food accessibility and challenging the notion of food sovereignty in an urban landscape by growing free fresh, green produce to stock our Playground Community Fridges. 
			<br><br>
			This initiative addresses the lack of food equity and grows our understanding of food systems so our neighborhood will be equipped to reclaim them. By reducing the margin of contact within the food distribution pipeline, Playground Greenhouse works to create a direct relationship between food and consumers, providing knowledge to community members of all ages on how to grow and harvest fresh, green produce in direct protest to food insecurity. </p>

			<p> <span id="bold-copy"> Take One Leave One Library: </span> The mission of the Take One, Leave One Free Library initiative is to provide free, thoughtful, and radical books by Black, Indigenous, Brown, POC, and LGBTQI+ authors to our community. The premise of taking a book and leaving one is an act of care, sharing stories, spreading resources, and amplification of voices that may have been overlooked. Through the library, we want to increase awareness around a myriad of topics and encourage the joy of reading. </p>
